I have been doing web development since I was 11 years old. Instead of going outside to play soccer, I focused on getting to know the web. HTML, CSS and Javascript was a big part of my early teens. I mostly learned these three by creating scripts for InvisionFree, a forum hosting platform which ran on a heavily modified IPB 1.3. We called them mods back in the day, short for modifications. These were simple scripts, modifying the DOM to add functionality.

After a while of doing this I got to know PHP. I was ecstatic knowing that instead of modifying the DOM, I could actually create my own dynamic content! And so I did. I got up to speed with PHP and started freelancing at the age of 14. The DigitalPoint forums were a huge help to that.
