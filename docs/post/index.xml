      <description>I try to avoid cloud services because I want to be in control of my data. This is why I self-host software on my personal VPS whenever there is a viable self-hosted alternative. This VPS is nothing impressive but does its job well. It runs the latest CentOS on a VPS with 1 vCPU, 2GB of RAM, a 50GB SSD and 2TB of bandwidth costing me about $15 per month (including backups).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.h2o.ai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;H2O&lt;/a&gt; is an open source machine learning platform. With H2O Flow you&amp;rsquo;re able to train models through a web interface, R or python. With H2O Steam you&amp;rsquo;re able to deploy the trained models, allowing you to call a HTTP endpoint to predict user behavior. Are you planning to host Flow and Steam on your own server? Here are a few things we learned by doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you use PhpStorm and have you ever wondered what all those fancy debugging features were? Or could you just not get Xdebug running in Docker or your Vagrant machine? Wonder no more!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Graylog for logging on Amazon ECS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At work we use &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AWS ECS&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon EC2 Container Service) for orchestrating our docker containers. We have a rather small
number of containers running (26~) which all log to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CloudWatch&lt;/a&gt;. Being unsatisfied by the features such as alerting we started looking for a better logging solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
